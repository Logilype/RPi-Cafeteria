# School Cafeteria Kiosk

## Description

This is still WORK IN PROGRESS, currently it is the second WIP commit.

This project consists of a client app (Electron app that is being run from npm) and a server (Node.JS web server), from which the client app gets its data from.

## Tutorial

To run the client app, go to the folder ```client``` and run ```npm start```

To run the server, go to the folder ```Server``` and run ```node .```

For the client app to work, the server must be running!
